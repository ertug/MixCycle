# MixCycle
The audio samples and the source code that accompany the paper: [Unsupervised Source Separation via Self-Supervised Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03875).

## Audio samples
We provide audio samples to demonstrate our results in this [notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/ertug/MixCycle/blob/main/notebooks/AudioSamples.ipynb).

## Source code
We will publish the source code here to help reproduce all of our experiments.
